<body>
    <div class="main">
        Insert main body text here. (This can be used for lesser important titles)
        <p>Insert body content here. (This can be used for the entire content of the title. So this in theory should be decently long so that it will look like a really long paragraph so that people can understand what the title means and what is the entire story behind making this. So I am just going to keep writing stuff here so I can see how long paragraphs will look for the body content section and then I can move stuff around according to the CSS and make things look nicer. Hopefully this will turn out just fine while looking nice and modern. After writing all of this, it still did not look long enough so I will continue to write more to see how bigger paragraphs will look like with this CSS style and hopefully this will be fine.)</p>
