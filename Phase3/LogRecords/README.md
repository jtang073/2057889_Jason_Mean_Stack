# Log Records Application Format

---

Adding records into records.json:
![Adding](/Phase3/LogRecords/images/lgAdd.png)

---

Records inside the records.json (manually added newlines at the end of every entry for better visualization but the program does NOT do that):
![Records](/Phase3/LogRecords/images/lgRecords.png)

---

Going through the debugging program with node inspect:
